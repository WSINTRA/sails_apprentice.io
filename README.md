# Sails backend for [https://github.com/WSINTRA/AngularPractise](https://github.com/WSINTRA/AngularPractise)

you can clone this repo and then
```yarn install```

In order to use the backend with a DB you will have to change ./config/datastores to your mongoDB
currently it is set to a free tier mongoDB from atlas and I have my IP set in the whitelist.

Once you have made those changes, start with
```sails lift```

Please see the frontEnd repo for more information about this project.
